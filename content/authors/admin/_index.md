I am an incoming CS PhD student at UIUC. I am interested in developing hardware and software for datacenters that are robust to changes for emerging software paradigms.

Before my PhD, I worked with Prof. [Akshitha Sriraman](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~asrirama/) and Dr. [Gilles Pokam](https://sites.google.com/site/gillespokam/home) to improve datacenter efficiency by characterizing datacenter tax operations.

Previously, I also worked on using Machine Learning to solve problems in Computational Chemistry.

I used [this slidedeck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1MytBcFC16K9toq-xN7fqbCBQkYqGV5OOrfKih8Sce3U/edit?usp=sharing) for my PhD interviews. It contains a brief summary of my research and education till the time I made those slides.
