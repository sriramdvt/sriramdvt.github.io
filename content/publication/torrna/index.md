abstract: RNA molecules play a significant role in many biological pathways and have diverse functional roles, which is a result of their structural flexibility to fold into diverse conformations. This structural flexibility makes it challenging to obtain the structures of RNAs experimentally. Deep learning can be used to predict the secondary structures of RNA and other properties such as the backbone torsion angles, to be used as restraints for the computational optimization of the tertiary structures of RNA. TorRNA is a transformer encoder-decoder model, that takes an input RNA sequence and predicts the (pseudo)torsion angles of each nucleotide with a pre-trained RNA-FM model as the encoder. TorRNA is able to achieve a performance boost of 2% âˆ’ 16% over the previous (pseudo)torsion angle prediction method for RNAs. We also demonstrate that TorRNA can used as a tool for model quality assessment of candidate RNA structures.
